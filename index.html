                        <p>AstroPaint is a Python package designed to generate and visualize sky maps of various astrophysical signals from dark matter halos and their host gas. It produces whole-sky mock maps at desired resolutions using input halo catalogs and astrophysical effect profiles. With its Object-Oriented, parallel design, AstroPaint offers tools for catalog filtering, map manipulation, and cutout stacking, allowing easy scalability for high-resolution maps and large catalogs. Although primarily developed for galaxy cluster signals, its applications extend to halos of any size or point sources.</p>

                        <p>The research focuses on creating a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional noble-metal-based catalysts. The nickel phosphine complex exhibits fast and efficient catalytic activity for hydrogen production, demonstrating its potential as a promising alternative in sustainable energy applications. The study highlights the importance of exploring non-noble metal-based catalysts for hydrogen production, paving the way for more sustainable and economical energy solutions.</p>

                        <p>This study explores the connection between molecular polarizability and conductance in electrified molecular interfaces. Results show that for a family of structurally connected molecules, conductance decreases as polarizability increases. This supports the idea that a molecule in a junction acts as a dielectric, polarized by the applied bias, creating a barrier that hinders tunneling. Using polarizability as a descriptor offers advantages over a molecular orbitals-based picture. The research uses Simmons' tunneling model, incorporating image charge and dielectric effects, to represent the molecular junction. Despite its simplicity, this model reveals a previously overlooked connection and encourages further investigation.</p>
