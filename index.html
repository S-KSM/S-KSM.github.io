            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm <strong>Shobeir Seddington</strong> <span>( Éo äÀàb…™r Ààs…õd…™≈ãt…ôn)</span></p>

                <p>As a highly skilled data science professional with over a decade of experience, I have led teams and driven impactful results across various industries. Currently, I serve as the <strong>Director of Data Science and Personalization</strong> at CVS Health, where I built a team to tackle personalization for over 2.5 billion visitors and established a test-and-learn culture. I am also a <strong>Harvard Business Review Advisor</strong>, contributing my expertise to their Advisory Council.</p>
                <p>In my previous role at GoPuff, I led a team of data scientists as the <strong>Principal Data Scientist</strong> and developed their experimentation program. I have also mentored PhDs in transitioning to data science careers as the <strong>Lead Program Developer</strong> at Cheeky Scientist's Data Science Syndicate.</p>
                <p>At Aetna, a CVS Health Company, I held multiple positions, including <strong>Senior Manager of Data Science</strong>, where I worked closely with healthcare startups and led a large team of data scientists. I won CVS's venture competition as part of the Signal team, leveraging state-of-the-art NLP and speech recognition algorithms.</p>
                <p>Before Aetna, I worked as a Data Scientist at Verra Mobility, where I optimized program deployment and identified new growth opportunities. I have also served as an <strong>Instructor</strong> at Arizona State University, where I optimized administrative processes and conducted studies to predict academic success.</p>

                        <p>AstroPaint is a Python package designed to generate and visualize sky maps of various astrophysical signals from dark matter halos and their host gas. It produces whole-sky mock maps at desired resolutions using input halo catalogs and astrophysical effect profiles. With its Object-Oriented, parallel design, AstroPaint offers tools for catalog filtering, map manipulation, and cutout stacking, allowing easy scalability for high-resolution maps and large catalogs. Although primarily developed for galaxy cluster signals, its applications extend to halos of any size or point sources.</p>

                        <p>This study explores the connection between molecular polarizability and conductance in electrified molecular interfaces. Results show that for a family of structurally connected molecules, conductance decreases as polarizability increases. This supports the idea that a molecule in a junction acts as a dielectric, polarized by the applied bias, creating a barrier that hinders tunneling. Using polarizability as a descriptor offers advantages over a molecular orbitals-based picture. The research uses Simmons' tunneling model, incorporating image charge and dielectric effects, to represent the molecular junction. Despite its simplicity, this model reveals a previously overlooked connection and encourages further investigation.</p>
